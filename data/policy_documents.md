## Fraud Detection Guidelines (Internal Use)

### Red Flags Requiring SIU Referral

**Accident Circumstances:**
- Late reporting (more than 72 hours after incident)
- Inconsistent statements between police report and FNOL
- No independent witnesses in parking lot or low-traffic areas
- Claimant or passengers have history of multiple claims
- Soft tissue injuries with no visible vehicle damage

**Vehicle Damage Patterns:**
- Pre-existing damage inconsistent with reported incident
- Damage location doesn't match impact description
- Vehicle value significantly less than repair estimate (potential total loss inflation)
- VIN tampering or salvage title not disclosed

**Financial Indicators:**
- Claimant recently increased coverage limits (within 30 days of loss)
- Claimant has outstanding loan balance far exceeding vehicle value
- Claimant requests direct payment instead of repair shop assignment
- Multiple claims across different insurers in short timeframe

### Bodily Injury Red Flags

**Medical Treatment Patterns:**
- Treatment begins weeks after accident
- Visits only to chiropractors/physical therapy (no ER or primary care)
- Treatment continues beyond typical recovery period
- Provider is known for high claim volumes
- Claimant has attorney involvement before medical diagnosis

**Litigation Risk Factors:**
- Attorney representation within 48 hours of loss
- Demand letters sent before medical treatment concludes
- Pre-litigation demands exceed policy limits
- Claimant has history of personal injury lawsuits

## Subrogation Policy

### When to Pursue Subrogation

**We will pursue subrogation recovery when:**
- Policyholder is 0% at fault (not-at-fault collision)
- Other party is identified with valid insurance
- Claim payout exceeds $2,500
- Police report assigns fault to other party
- Potential recovery exceeds cost of pursuit (minimum $5,000)

**Subrogation Process:**
1. Pay policyholder's collision claim (waive deductible if other party at fault)
2. Send demand letter to at-fault party's insurer
3. Negotiate settlement or file arbitration
4. Reimburse policyholder's deductible if full recovery obtained
5. Recover claim payout amount

**We will NOT pursue subrogation if:**
- Comparative negligence exceeds 25%
- Other party is uninsured with no assets
- Claim amount below $2,500
- Statute of limitations has expired
- Other party is household member or family

## Total Loss Valuation Guidelines

### Determining Actual Cash Value (ACV)

**ACV Calculation Formula:**
ACV = Comparable Vehicle Market Value - Pre-Existing Damage - Excessive Wear/Tear

**Comparable Vehicle Criteria:**
- Same year, make, model, trim level
- Within 10,000 miles of subject vehicle mileage
- Similar condition (clean title, no major repairs)
- Within 100-mile radius of loss location
- Sold within 45 days of loss date

**Pre-Existing Damage Deductions:**
- Prior accident damage not repaired: Deduct estimated repair cost
- Rust, body damage, mechanical issues: Deduct depreciation
- Missing or non-functional features: Deduct replacement cost

**Total Loss Settlement:**
1. Determine ACV using 3-5 comparable vehicles
2. Deduct applicable deductible
3. Deduct salvage value (if insured retains vehicle)
4. Pay net settlement amount
5. Require title transfer (if salvage not retained)

**Total Loss Threshold:** Repair cost ≥ 75% of ACV
